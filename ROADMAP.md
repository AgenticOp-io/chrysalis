# Chrysalis - Roadmap

> Read `DESIGN.md` first. This file is the **active** execution plan.
> Completed history is archived in [`ROADMAP-ARCHIVE.md`](./ROADMAP-ARCHIVE.md).

## Status (2026-06)

- **Releases:** `v1.0.0` -> `v2.0.x` tagged on `main`.
- **Active lanes:** **maintenance only** — phases **0–11 closed** (**G5680–G6290**).
- **Recently shipped:** **G6280–G6290** Phase 11 honest gaps implementation (2026-06-19).

## Default queue — maintenance

Phases **0–11 closed**. Reactive maintenance only — see [`PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md`](./docs/PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md) §2.

**Verify:** `pnpm run hub:maintenance-program-complete-smoke`, `pnpm run hub:honest-gaps-implementation-close-smoke`

Closed programs: Phase 10, Phase 11 (`docs/HONEST-GAPS-PHASE-11.md`).

## Maintenance hygiene

Reactive work (parser probes, hole economics, docs, redaction) — see [`PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md`](./docs/PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md) §2.

**Full CI-scale tests:** `pnpm run test:gce` — [`docs/GCE-LOCAL-VERIFY.md`](./docs/GCE-LOCAL-VERIFY.md).
