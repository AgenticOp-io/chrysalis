## 0. How to use this document


| User message sounds like                            | Treat as                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Build …”, “Implement …”, “Add …”, “Fix …”          | Implementation request (still must fit this plan)                                                           |
| “What if …”, “Should we …”, “Can we …”, “Explain …” | **Clarification** — answer in plan terms; **do not fork** unless user explicitly approves a plan change     |
| “Also do X” without “build”                         | **Question** — is X on-plan or off-plan? Say which phase/workstream it belongs to, or that it is **paused** |
| “Forget the plan, do Y”                             | Requires **explicit** plan amendment: `DESIGN.md` Decision Log + edit this file + user approval             |


**North star metrics (customer outcomes, not repo vanity):**

- Time to first green verify on a customer slice
- Route correctness at cutover (in-scope routes)
- Hole density trend (explicit budget)
- Dual-stack / session / SQL parity in production
- Migration cost per route (declining via Hub automation)

**Not north-star metrics:** new matrix pairs for marketing, CWL RFCs without oracle/replay linkage, hub UI without verify/evidence tie-in.

---

## 1. One-sentence strategy

**Win verified migration with oracle and Hub operations while promoting CWL from interchange contract to a full-stack authoring language + runtime surface: own the semantic layer of the web by making credible delivery depend on WebIR + oracle + CWL contracts and, where mature, CWL-authored applications.**

---

## 2. What we are building (three layers)


| Layer      | What it is                                                 | Pays bills?             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Engine** | Record → WebIR → emit → verify → chimera                   | Yes (PHP wedge)         |
| **Hub**    | Multi-site migration operations + evidence loop            | Yes (programs at scale) |
| **CWL**    | Canonical text form of WebIR; interchange + RFC absorption | Yes (long-term moat)    |


The **PHP-to-TypeScript converter** is the **adoption vector**. The **framework** (WebIR, runtime, holes, chimera) is the **product**. **CWL** is how we **own the semantic center** over time.

---

## 3. Honest capability tiers (how we talk externally)


| Tier                     | Meaning                                                               | Examples                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Oracle product**       | Behavioral capture + ingest + emit + verify on real traces            | PHP → hono / fastify / nextjs / typescript (4 matrix pairs) |
| **Structural plumbing**  | Hole-free lift/emit on toy/literal fixtures; trace replay where gated | Hub gold suites (119+ structural); most matrix pairs        |
| **Scaffold / advisory**  | Route shells, file-lift, planning APIs                                | Pattern-lift origins; path knowledge; migration planner     |
| **Paused (do not sell)** | No oracle + no real-app depth                                         | Vanity matrix pairs without customer route                  |
| **Phase 10 (closed)**    | Production parity reinforcement shipped; maintenance default queue         | See `docs/PRODUCTION-PARITY-PHASE-10.md` (archive)      |


**Rule:** Never imply structural matrix gold equals production migration for that pair.

---

## 4. Three horizons (do not skip)

```text
Horizon 1 (0–18 mo)  — PHP wedge: oracle + verify + chimera + Laravel/plain depth
Horizon 2 (6–15 mo)  — Hub as migration OS: evidence dashboard + programs
Horizon 3 (9–48 mo)  — CWL interchange → authoring; optional runtime last
```

Horizon 2 may overlap Horizon 1; Horizon 3 must not block Horizon 1 delivery.

---

## 5. The usefulness engine (evidence factory)

Closed loop — **all product work should strengthen this loop:**

```text
Capture (oracle) → Gap (verify/insight) → Fix (ingest/repair, verify-gated)
  → Re-emit → Re-verify → Update knowledge (path-knowledge, CWL RFC, playbooks)
```

**Hub** is the control plane for this loop, not only SSH + translate.

---

## 6. CWL: what “dominate the web” means

**Dominance** = any serious migration or contract-first API program can express truth in **CWL/WebIR**, prove it with **oracle** (or contract gold), and emit to targets.

**CWL is:**

- Canonical text form of WebIR for routes/handlers/effects
- Interchange between hub, CLI, OpenAPI/HAR/WPTP
- Accumulator of cross-language patterns (RFC process with gold + synthesis)

**CWL is not:**

- A substitute for verify or oracle
- Validated by matrix pair count
- A shortcut to skip evidence gates

**Stages:**


| Stage             | When                   | Win                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — Spec**      | Now → 12 mo            | Reviewable migration contracts                                                |
| **B — Sink**      | 12–24 mo               | Every lift exports CWL projection; OpenAPI/HAR → CWL                          |
| **C — Authoring** | start now; accelerate  | Greenfield services authored in CWL as soon as ergonomics are viable          |
| **D — Runtime**   | start now; phase-gated | Deployable CWL runtime is a first-class target, with emit+verify parity gates |


**Dominance metric:** % of migrated routes with a signed **CWL contract** (+ hole manifest), not GitHub stars.

## 8. Workstream priority (build vs pause)


| Priority | Build                                                                         | Pause                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0**   | PHP oracle E2E, verify playbooks, Hub evidence UI                             | Random matrix pairs                               |
| **P0**   | Laravel/plain PHP ingest from verify gaps                                     | CWL RFC without replay                            |
| **P1**   | CWL HTTP + full-stack surface (body, response, effects, authoring/runtime UX) | Vanity matrix pairs without customer route        |
| **P1**   | Project-to-CWL export                                                         | Hub UI without delivery metrics                   |
| **P1**   | CWL runtime acceleration with parity gates                                    | Runtime claims without verify parity              |
| **P1**   | Phase 10: production SQL/session, WordPress entry, matrix expansion             | 575×26 marketing matrix                           |
| **P2**   | Second oracle origin                                                          | Rust/Kotlin oracle before Node/Python flagship    |
| **P2**   | WordPress vertical (Phase 10 entry)                                           | Many literal-only gold suites                     |

## 9. Knowledge base (make actionable)

Path knowledge + web DB catalog + synthesis → **playbooks**:

- Pair advice tied to **verify divergence codes**
- Effort / hole forecasts per origin
- DB catalog → emit hints (ORM/SQL layer)
- CWL RFC backlog ranked by **corpus frequency**, not excitement

---

## 10. Business shape (alignment)

1. **Assessment** — scan + small capture + readiness report
2. **Pilot** — fixed route slice, verify threshold
3. **Program** — Hub batch, correctness SLA, chimera support
4. **Platform license** — CLI + Hub + oracle (not per-language SKUs)

---

## 11. Explicit non-goals (even if requested casually)

Without plan amendment, treat these as **out of scope**:

- Chasing full **575×26 production** migration parity for marketing  
- Claiming production-ready CWL runtime without parity evidence (verify + contract coverage)  
- Promising **any web app, any language** without second-oracle flagship evidence  
- LLM repair that bypasses verify  
- Rebranding structural-only matrix depth as full-stack oracle parity

**Amended 2026-06-19 (Phase 11):** Honest gaps implementation (**G6280–G6290**) — WordPress customer sample oracle, north-star metrics automation, commercial launch verify, IR helper B6, WPTP D7 harness. See `docs/HONEST-GAPS-PHASE-11.md`.

---

## 12. Default queue (maintenance)

**Status:** **maintenance only** (2026-06-19). Strategic plan phases **0–10** and Phase 11 honest gaps **closed** (**G5680–G6290**).

When the user says "build" without specifying:

1. Use **maintenance** triggers in [`docs/PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md`](./PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md) §2.
2. Do **not** treat archive ship logs or closed phase docs as active backlog.
3. Verify: `pnpm run hub:maintenance-program-complete-smoke`, `pnpm run hub:honest-gaps-implementation-close-smoke`.

Closed programs: Phase 10 (`docs/PRODUCTION-PARITY-PHASE-10.md`), Phase 11 (`docs/HONEST-GAPS-PHASE-11.md`).

**Index:** [`docs/PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md`](./PAUSED-AND-MAINTENANCE.md).

---

## 13. Amending this plan

1. User explicitly requests a strategy change.
2. Add `**DESIGN.md` Decision Log** entry (why).
3. Edit this file and `**ROADMAP.md`** strategic section.
4. Do not silently implement off-plan work.
